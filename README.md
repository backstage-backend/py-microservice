Prueba de integración entre Backstage y GitHub

## API

The generated API is `transactions` and is mounted at
`/api/v1/pse`.

The service exposes an in-memory REST API for `items`. The OpenAPI contract is available at [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml).

| Method   | Path                                 | Description     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/pse`      | List all items  |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/pse`      | Create an item  |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/pse/{id}` | Get an item     |
| `PUT`    | `/api/v1/pse/{id}` | Replace an item |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/pse/{id}` | Delete an item  |

`GET /health` returns the service status and is used by deployment probes.
New Relic is enabled when the generated service is started with the
`NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` and `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` environment variables. The
agent is intentionally optional for local development.

An item requires a non-empty `name` and accepts an optional `description`. Data is stored in memory and is lost when the service restarts.

## CI configuration

The CI workflow supports an optional SonarCloud scan. To enable it, configure
the repository or organization secret `SONAR_TOKEN` and the repository variable
`SONAR_ENABLED` with the value `true`. The scan is skipped otherwise, so builds
do not fail when SonarCloud credentials are not available. The SonarCloud URL
is set explicitly to `https://sonarcloud.io`.

The scan uses the GitHub repository as the SonarCloud project key and
`backstage-backend` as the SonarCloud organization. If your SonarCloud
organization is different, update `sonar.organization` in the generated
workflow.

The CD workflow listens for the completion of `Build Validation` on `main`.
It deploys only after CI succeeds; a failed or cancelled CI run cannot trigger
deployment. Manual `workflow_dispatch` remains available for an explicit
deployment.

## AWS deployment

The selected deployment option uses the common `.github/workflows/cd.yml`
workflow for deployment.

Kubernetes services connect to the existing EKS cluster and apply the
generated manifests with `kubectl`. The service repository does not use
Terraform to manage the generated Kubernetes Deployment, Service, or Ingress;
the EKS cluster and its shared infrastructure are managed separately.

Lambda Python deployments install only `requirements-runtime.txt` into the
`src/` package. Test-only dependencies remain in `requirements.txt` and are
not included in the Lambda ZIP.

Before running the workflow, configure the `aws-infrastructure` environment
with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and these variables:
`AWS_REGION`, `TF_STATE_BUCKET`, `API_GATEWAY_NAME`, and
`EKS_CLUSTER_NAME`. Only the variables needed by the selected deployment are
used. For Kubernetes, `EKS_CLUSTER_NAME` may also be stored as a secret with
that name. The AWS identity must be allowed to deploy Lambda/API Gateway
resources or to access the configured EKS cluster.

Lambda services use the existing REST API Gateway and expose the service under
`/<service-name>/{proxy+}`. Terraform discovers the existing REST API by the
configured `API_GATEWAY_NAME`, so no account resource ID is stored in the
generated repository. Because the API has no stage, Terraform creates the
deployment and the CD workflow creates or updates the shared `prod` stage.
The resulting URL is `/prod/<service-name>/{proxy+}`. Before applying Terraform, the CD workflow
removes API Gateway methods that have no integration, which are left behind by
incomplete API Gateway deployments and prevent a new deployment from being
created.

For example, a service named `lambda-node` is reachable at:

```text
https://<api-id>.execute-api.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/prod/lambda-node/api/v1/items
```

Kubernetes services deploy to the EKS cluster configured in
`EKS_CLUSTER_NAME` and expose an internet-facing ALB path under
`/<service-name>/*`. The EKS cluster must have the AWS Load Balancer Controller
installed. The CD workflow publishes the container image, configures
`kubectl` against the cluster, and applies the generated manifests from
`k8s/`.
